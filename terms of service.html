                        one or more Third-Party Fonts have been incorporated into the Project 
                        and that Client will need to purchase one or more licenses for the 
                        Third-Party Fonts from the rights-holder(s) of said Third Party Fonts 
                        in order to legally reproduce, distribute, or publicly display the 
                        Project. Said notice will include information sufficient for Client 
                        to identify which licenses are required and who to contact in order 
                        to purchase said licenses. So long as ProjectXYZ has informed Client of 
                        the incorporation of Third-Party Fonts as described above, Client assumes 
                        all responsibility for any consequences as a result of a failure by 
                        Client to purchase one or more licenses for any Third-Party Fonts 
                        incorporated into a Project.
